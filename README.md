# SLAM
## Are YOU tired of constantly wrangling with git commands?

That's right...

# *SLAM* your problems away!




If you can't tell from the way this is written, slam is not a serious tool.  Its a glorified wrapper that collapses the git workflow down to just push and pull so I don't have to deal with mountains of git nonsense when I'm *THE ONLY ONE WORKING ON ANY OF THIS CRAP*.  Please, don't use this unless you're really sure its what you want.
